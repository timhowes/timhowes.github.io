At the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, I lead projects to analyze molecular and cell profiling data from clinical trials to better understand how patients respond to immunotherapy treatments. In my prior academic research, I studied the genetic basis of morphological development and the mechanisms of gene regulation in model organisms.\nPlease see the links to the left for descriptions of previous research projects and publications."
